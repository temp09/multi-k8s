Now, that we've covered GCP networks at a high level, let's go deeper by exploring IP addresses. In GCP, each virtual machine can have two IP addresses assigned. One of them is an internal IP address, which is going to be assigned via DHCP internally. Every VM that starts up and any service that depends on a virtual machine gets an internal IP address. Example of such services are, App Engine and Kubernetes Engine, which are explored in other courses. When you create a VM in GCP, its symbolic name is registered with an internal DNS service that translates the name to the internal IP address. DNS is scoped to the network, so it can translate web URLs and VM names of hosts in the same network, but it can't translate host names from VMs in a different network. The other IP address is the external IP address. But this one is optional. You can assign an external IP address if your device or your machine is externally facing. That external IP address can be signed from a pool, making it ephemeral or it can be signed a reserved external IP address, making its static. Remember that you are billed for reserving external IP addresses when they are not attached to a running VM. For more information on this, please refer to the link below the video.
