Let me show you how to
expand a subnet within GCP. I've gone ahead and created a custom
subnet here with a slash 29 mask. And a slash 29 mask provides eight
addresses, but four of those are reserved, leaving me with another four for
my VM instances. So I can click in here, and you'll see
that I already have four VM instances. So let's try to create another
VM instance in this subnet. Now the subnet is in us-west1, so
I'm going to go create an instance, and specify the region for that. Without changing anything else,
I'm just going to try to click Create. All right, so as we can see, I did not get
a green check mark next to my instance, instead I got an exclamation sign. And if I hover over that
I get the actual error, that the IP space of the specific
subnet has been exhausted. So as expected, I can only create four
VM instances with a slash 29 mask. But I want to show you how to expand that. So let's go ahead and go to the Subnet. And I'm going to directly
click on my Subnet, and click the EDIT icon up here to
now change this address range. So let's for
example change that to a slash 24, that's going to allow over 200 instances
in here, and I'm just going to click Save. Now I'm doing all of this without
taking any of my VM instances down. And we can see up here
in the notification, That this is currently being updated. And we can see here that it's now
reflected and I'll have this /24. So let's go back to my instance page,
and what I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to hit this retry
button over here to see if I can recreate that instance within that
subnet now that I've expanded it. All right, so we can see that the instance
has been created successfully and is running. And that's how easy it is
to expand a subnet in GCP without any workload shutdown or
down time.
