Let's learn a little bit
about Cloud Dataprep. Cloud Dataprep is an Intelligent Data Service
for visually exploring, cleaning, and preparing
structured and unstructured data for analysis reporting
and Machine Learning. Because Cloud Dataprep is serverless and
works at any skill, there's no infrastructure
to deploy are manage. Your next ideal data
transformation is suggested and predicted with each UI input so you don't have to write code. With automatic
schema, data types, possible joins and
anomaly detection, you can skip time-consuming
Data Profiling and focus on Data Analysis. Cloud Dataprep is an integrated partner
service operated by Trifacta and based on their
industry leading Data Preparation Solution
Trifacta Wrangler. Google works closely
with Trifacta to provide a seamless user experience that removes the need for upfront
software installation, separate licensing costs or
ongoing operational overhead. Cloud Dataprep is fully-managed
and scales on demand to meet your growing data
preparation needs so you can stay
focused on analysis. Here's an example of a Cloud
Dataprep architecture. As you can see, Cloud
Dataprep can be leveraged to prepare
raw data from BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or a file
upload before ingesting it into a transformational
pipeline like Cloud Data flow. The refined data can
then be exported to BigQuery or Cloud Storage for analysis and
machine learning.
