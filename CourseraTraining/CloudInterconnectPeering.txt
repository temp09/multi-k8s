Next, let's talk about Cloud Interconnect
and Peering services. There are different
Cloud Interconnect and Peering services available to connect your infrastructure
to Google's network. These services can be
split into dedicated versus shared connections and layer two verses layer
three connections. The services are Direct Peering, Carrier Peering,
Dedicated Interconnect, and Partner Interconnect. Dedicated connections provide a direct connection
to Google's network. But, shared connections provide a connection to Google's
network through a partner. Layer two connections
use a VLAN that pipes directly into
your GCP environment, providing connectivity
to internal IP addresses in the RFC 1918 address space. Layer three connections provide access to G Suite services, YouTube and Google Cloud APIs
using public IP addresses. Now as I just explained earlier, Google also offers its own Virtual Private Network
service called Cloud VPN. This service uses the public
Internet but traffic is encrypted and provides access
to internal IP addresses. That's why Cloud VPN is a useful addition to Direct
Peering and Carrier Peering. Let me explain the
Cloud Interconnect and Peering services separately first and then I'll provide some guidance on choosing
the right connection.
