Cloud Armor works with Global HTTP(S) load balancing to provide the built-in defense against infrastructure Distributed Denial of Service or DDos attacks. Cloud Armor benefits from over a decade of experience protecting some of the world's largest Internet properties, like Google Search, Gmail, and YouTube. Cloud Armor enables you to restrict or allow access to the HTTPS load balancer at the edge of the GCP network, meaning as close as possible to the user and to malicious traffic. For example, in this diagram, Sarah in San Francisco and Shen in Singapore are two employees who are allowed to access your HTTP load balancer. Therefore, their traffic will be forwarded to the backend in the US-West2 region and the backend in the Asia-Southeast1 region, respectively. A DDos attack on the other hand, can be blocked directly at the edge without consuming resources or entering your VPC network. Cloud Armour uses security policies to blacklist or whitelist, meaning restrict or allow access to HTTPS load balancer. Blacklisting gives you the ability to block a source IP address or CIDR range from accessing HTTPS load balancers. Whereas, whitelisting gives you the ability to allow a source IP address or CIDR range to access HTTPS as load balancers. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported in whitelist and blacklist rules. You even have control over the deny rule, by configuring it to display a 403, 404, or 502 error code. Also when multiple rules are configured, you can designate the order in which the rules are evaluated by assigning a priority.
