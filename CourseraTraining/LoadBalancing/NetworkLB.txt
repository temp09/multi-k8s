Next, let's talk about network load balancing, which is a regional load balancing service. Network load balancing is a regional, non-proxied load balancing service. In other words, all traffic is passed through the load balancer instead of being proxied, and traffic can only be balanced between VM instances that are in the same region, unlike a global load balancer. This load balancing service uses forwarding rules to balance the load on your systems based on incoming IP protocol data, such as address, port, and protocol type. You can use it to load balance UDP traffic, and to load balance TCP and SSL traffic on ports that are not supported by the TCP proxy and SSL proxy load balances that we just discussed. The backends of a network load balancer can be a template-based instance group or a target pool resource. But, what is a target pool resource? A target pool resource defines a group of instances that receive incoming traffic from forwarding rules. When a forwarding rule directs traffic to a target pool, the load balancer picks an instance from these target pools based on a hash of the source IP and port, and the destination IP and port. These targets pools can only be used with forwarding rules that can handle TCP and UDP traffic. Now, each project can have up to 50 target pools, and each target pool can have only one health check. Also, all the instances of a target pool must be in the same region, which is the same limitation as within network load balancer.
