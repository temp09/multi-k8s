TCP proxy is a lobal load balancing service for unencrypted non- HTTP traffic. This load balancer terminates your customers TCP session at the load balancing layer and then forwards the traffic to your virtual machine instances using TCP or SSL. These instances can be in multiple regions and the load balancer automatically directs traffic to the closest region that has capacity. TCP proxy load balancing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for client traffic. Now, similar to the SSL proxy load balancer, the TCP proxy load balancer provides intelligent routing and security patching. For the full list of ports supported by the TCP proxy load balancing and other benefits, please refer to the documentation linked below this video. This network diagram illustrates TCP proxy load balancing. In this example, traffic from users in Iowa and Boston is terminated at the global load balancing layer. From there, a separate connection is established to the closest back end instance. Similar to the SSL proxy load balancing example, the user in Boston would reach the US East region and the user in Iowa would reach the US Central region as long as there's enough capacity. Now, the traffic between the proxy and back ends can use SSL or TCP.
