Next let's talk about network load balancing which is a regional load
balancing service. Network load balancing is a regional non proxied
load balancing service. In other words, all traffic is passed through the load
balancer instead of being proxied and traffic
can only be balanced between virtual machine
instances that are in the same region unlike
a global load balancer. This load balancing service uses forwarding rules to
balance the load on your systems based on incoming IP protocol
data such as address, port, and protocol type. You can use it to load balance
UDP traffic and to load balance TCP NSSL traffic
on ports that are not supported by the TCP proxy
and SSL proxy load balancers. The back ends of a network
load balancer can be a template-based instance group or target pooled resource. But what is the
target pool resource? A target pool resource
defines a group of instances that receive incoming traffic from
forwarding rules. When a forwarding rule direct
traffic to a target pool, the load balancer
picks an instance from these target pools based on hash of the source IP and port, and the destination IP and port. These target pools
can only be used with forwarding rules that
handled TCP and UDP traffic. Now each project can have up to 50 target pools and each target pool can have
only one health check. Also, all the instances of
a target pool must be in the same region which is the same limitation as for
the network load balancer.
