TCP proxy is a global
load balancing service for unencrypted non-HTTP traffic. This load balancer
terminates your customers TCP sessions at the
load balancing layer, then forwards the traffic to your virtual machine
instances using TCP or SSO. These instances can be in multiple regions and
the load balancer automatically directs traffic to the closest region
that has capacity. TCP proxy load balancing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
for Client Traffic. Similar to SSL proxy
load balancer, the TCP proxy load
balancer provides intelligent routing
and security patching. For the fullest
reports supported by TCP proxy load balancing
and other benefits, please refer to the links
section of this video. This network diagram illustrates TCP proxy load balancing. In this example, traffic
from users in Iowa and Boston is terminated at the
Global Load Balancing layer. From there, a separate
connection is established to the
closest backend instance. As in the SSL proxy
load balancing example, the users in Boston would reach the US East region
and the user in Iowa which reach the
US central region, if there's enough capacity. Now the traffic between the proxy and the
backends can use SSL or TCP and I also
recommend using SSL here.
