BigQuery is GCP's serverless, highly scalable, and cost
effective Cloud data warehouse. It's a petabyte scale data
warehouse that allows for super-fast queries using the processing power of
Google's infrastructure. Because there's no infrastructure
for you to manage, you can focus on uncovering meaningful insights
using familiar SQL, without the need for the
database administrator. BigQuery is used by all
types of organizations, and there's a free usage tier
to help you get started. For more information, see the links section of this video. You can access BigQuery
by using the GCP console, by using the command line tool, or by making calls to
the BigQuery REST API, using the variety
of client libraries such as Java,.NET or Python. There are also several
third-party tools that you can use to
interact with BigQuery, such as visualizing the data, or loading the data. Here's an example of
a query on the table with over 100 billion rows. This query processes
over 4.1 terabyte, but takes less than
a minute to execute. The same query would take hours if not days through
a serial execution.
