Amdad is a very involved team player and a pleasure to work with.  He has a very positive attitude and never complains about anything.  His good mood makes him very easy to work with as well.



Amdad has successfully met his goals while focusing most of his attention on his current Apigee project.   Learning and progression of goals will continue as the Apigee project is completed.



I admire his willingness to take on any project and give 100% to that project.

Amdad is very proficient at setting up monitoring solution for Apigee, using Zabbix and New Relic.  He practices our Winning Behaviors on a daily basis.  He is eager to learn new or unfamiliar technology, and is also doing all of the operational support for 100+ linux Apigee servers.

He is always willing to learn and lead, and is a great asset to Intrado.  I look forward to his continues growth.

Amdad has learned a variety of things since the last appraisal, and is eager to continue learning additional things.  He is always willing to help any of his peers with their workload or issues,  He is very pleasant and always has a positive attitude, never complaining.  He is an active listener and asks questions if he doesn't understand something or needs more information.

I enjoy having him as part of the team, and look forward to seeing his continued growth and ability to support additional platforms.

I believe I am leading as outstanding support, troubleshoot , resolving for our apigee platform and CICD ( Jenkins, JFrog Artifactory, Xray, Mission-control and SonarQube ) platform along with helping segmentation for of those tools/ product for Intrado.

I also resolve the vulnerabilities as industry standard way  for Intrado.

Also I believe I am a good candidate for be working as lead Engineer with Intrado.

 Amdad has been tasked with much more responsibility recently, and has successfully stepped up to the challenge.  He is always eager to learn new things, does his research on things he is not familiar with, and shares his knowledge willingly.   He communicates with colleagues and others that are outside of the company.  He proactively researches and determines a path forward when faced with obstacles.

Amdad is an asset to my team and Intrado.  I enjoy working with him and look forward to many more years of success.
