Kevin,
I tested for old DB with provided credentials it works for LON13 server, but for new DB it's say 

Xray:
[aullah@led01565 ~]$ psql -h 10.85.114.55 -U xray xraydb_03 --password
Password for user xray:
psql: FATAL:  no pg_hba.conf entry for host "10.85.116.85", user "xray", database "xraydb_03", SSL off 

artifactory:
[aullah@led01564 pgsql-12.4]$ psql -h 10.85.114.55 -U artifactory artifactory_n03 --password
Password for user artifactory:
psql: FATAL:  no pg_hba.conf entry for host "10.85.116.84", user "artifactory", database "artifactory_n03", SSL off

OLd DB conectiviety  works !!!!!:
[root@led01565 ~]# psql -h 10.85.116.118 -U xray xraydb_03 --password
Password for user xray:
psql (9.2.24, server 9.6.6)

artifactory_n03=# 

For SWN and DEN , I was trying to use your tar but it shows some error , so I was not able to test for those 2 because of psql client.

Error shows 
"[root@led35658 pgsql-12.4]# psql -h 10.70.115.127 -U artifactory artifactory_n02 --password
psql: error while loading shared libraries: libpq.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

Any idea what need to be done in here for psql client?

Thanks

The Postgres DB configuration for Artifactory and X-ray is completed now. Artifactory and X-ray is up and running.


We will be performing a migration of the Artifactory postgres database in the PRODUCTION environment starting on Monday 01-31-2022 from 2300 CST for 4 hours to a different server under CHG0155385.
